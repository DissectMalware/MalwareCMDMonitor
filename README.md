# Introduction
By using this python script, you can observe the commands of the latest malware instances executed on [hybrid-analysis.com](hybrid-analysis.com) sandbox. In a nutshell, it downloads the HA feed and then retrieves commands of unseen instances; the ones that did not appear in the previous feeds.

# Prerequisite
You only need to install Python 3 on your system.

# Running the script
To run the script 

```
python  hybrid_analysis.py
```

However, if you want to run the script on a regular basis, you can use --daemon (or -d for short) switch.

```
python  hybrid_analysis.py --daemon
```

Running the above command results in getting the feed every hour. To change the interval, you can use --cycle (or -c) and specify the number of minutes the script must wait before retrieving the feed again.

```
python  hybrid_analysis.py --daemon --cycle 120
```

In the above example, the script sleeps for 2 hours between each feed retrieval. Moreover, you can use --output (or -o) to specify the output file that you want to store the results. By default, the output is written on the console.

```
python  hybrid_analysis.py --daemon --cycle 120 --output "c:\test\ha - cmd.log"
```

Last but not least, you can see all the switches by using --help (or -h)

```
python hybrid_analysis.py -h
```
